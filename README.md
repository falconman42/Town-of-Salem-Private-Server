The role wheel will look strange with random roles.
Skins are randomized.

While you can make whatever role list you like do not expect them to work properly. Adding in multple jailors is possible but will most likely not work very well and possibly crash.

Role list is stored in gamemodes/Classic.js

Joining any gamemode will put you in a classic lobby and the role list shown will not reflect your custom list since it's hardcoded in.
