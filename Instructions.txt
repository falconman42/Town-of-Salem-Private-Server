If you are hosting the server you can use either "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" to connect but ONLY YOURSELF

Other clients will need to use your IP which you can find here: https://www.whatsmyip.org/

You will also need to forward whatever port you're using. The port can be changed in config.json and will need to be forwarded in your router control panel.
