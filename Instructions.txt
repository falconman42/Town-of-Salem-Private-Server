To connect to a server put the IP followed by the port in the password box in the format ip:port

As an example:
username: falconman42
password: 127.0.0.1:3600

Only the HOST OF THE SERVER can use 127.0.0.1. Other clients will need the hosts IP address which can be found here: https://www.whatsmyip.org/ 

You will also need to forward whatever port the server is using from your routers control panel. Use Google if you're unsure of how to do this.

The port can be changed in config.json, the default port is 3600.
